## Overview



## Individual Contributions

In this section, note down 1 or 2 sentences *per team member* outlining everyone's contribution to the project. We want to see that everybody contributed, but you don't need to get into fine details. For example, write who contributed to which feature of your solution, but do *not* write who implemented a particular function.
